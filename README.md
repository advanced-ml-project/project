## Summary 
A diverse set of opinions and ideas in public discourse is desirable for many reasons, including the generation of novel solutions to social issues and the health of a nation's democracy. In fact, in the early days of social media, the internet was heralded as a tool to usher in a new age where everyone's voice could be heard, counted and healthy public debate would ensue (Puglisi & Snyder, 2015). Current views, however, center on the opposite: society appears to be increasingly polarized and hostile in online interactions. Online spaces have become the target of criticism and fears about cyberbullying, trolling, fake news and the potential for vulnerable individuals to become violently radicalized.
Because isolation and antagonism prevents the kind of generative dialog social media at its best can create, we seek to understand and explore the mechanisms involved in online polarization. We will examine if identifiable biasing traits in traditional media sources may be predictive of increased polarization in user comments using a neural network text analysis of twitter posts. We will use a variety of tools and approaches found in relevant machine learning research.
